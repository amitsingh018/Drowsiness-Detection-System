						<p>Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads.</p>
						<p>Our proposed system used the eye closure ratio as input parameter to detect the drowsiness of the driver. If the eye closure ratio deteriorates from the standard ratio, the driver is alerted with the help of a buzzer. For our system, a Pi camera is used to capture the images of the driver's eye</p>
						<p>Prior to deducting that a driver is drowsy, the eye aspect ratio (EAR) is calculated to detect the driver with drowsiness.<br>
						 the eye aspect ratio function which is used to compute the ratio of distances between the vertical eye landmarks and the distances between the horizontal eye landmarks. In order to calculate distance, the Euclidean Distance of the eye region is used.</p>
						<center><b><i><p>D(PtQ)=(Σni=1(Qi−Pi)^2)^1/2</p></i></b></center>
						<p>where D(P,Q) is the Euclidean distance between points P and Q. In Cartesian coordinates Pi and Qi are two points in Euclidean n-space.</p>
